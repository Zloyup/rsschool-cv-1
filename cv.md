## About me
I'm 19 y.o. I'm studying in university as economist-programmer. So I have some experience in coding. I had labs on C, C++ and Java. I liked to write JSTL apps on Java and servlets the most.
I'm highly motivated and super excited to learn about JS and start working in this domain. I have some skills in programming, but always want to know more.
